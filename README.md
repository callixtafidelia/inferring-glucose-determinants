# Inferring the Relationship Between Blood Glucose Levels and Clinical Health Indicators

## Overview

This project investigates the statistical relationship between blood glucose concentration and physiological health indicators. The goal is to quantify and interpret clinically relevant associations through multivariate regression modeling and rigorous diagnostic analysis.

## Methodology

- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Multiple linear regression model
- Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) assessment 
- Cook’s Distance to detect high-leverage observations
- Assumption checking (linearity, normality, homoscedasticity, leverage assessment)

## Key Findings

- Age is positively associated with higher glucose levels
- BloodPressure shows a statistically significant positive association
- All retained predictors are significant at the 5% level

## Interpretation

Higher insulin levels, increased age, and elevated blood pressure are significantly associated with higher blood glucose levels. These findings align with established biological mechanisms underlying insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes risk.
